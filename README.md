# practicalli-landing-page

The website brings together all the content created for the Practicalli series on Functional programming with Clojure.

## Overview

This web page was created with ClojureScript, reagent, figwheel-main and Bulma CSS framework.

The project was created with Leiningen build tool and using the figwheel-main template, with reagent option.

`lein new figwheel-main` practicalli-landing-page -- --reagent

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

### Run via Spacemacs

Open one of the ClojureScript source code files, e.g. `src/practicalli_landing_page/core.cljs`

`, '` and select the `cider-jack-in-cljs` option (or use `, s j s`).

Select `figwheel-main` when prompted for build tool

Select `dev` when prompted for the profile


### Run via the command line

Open a terminal and run the following command to start a REPL

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein clean
    lein fig:live

### Deploying to Test

Copy the following files and directories to the `/docs` directory:

- `resources/public/index.html`
- `resources/public/css`
- `resources/public/images`

Also copy the following file to `/docs/cljs-out/` directory

- `resources/public/cljs-out/dev-main.js`


### Deploy to Live

Clone the `practicalli.github.io` repository

`git clone git@github.com:practicalli/practicalli.github.io.git`

Copy all files and directories from the `/docs` directory to the root of that repository.

`cp -r ../practicalli-landing-page/docs/* .`
